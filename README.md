# Filename changer tool in python.

This is a automatic tool developped to fit my personal needs for changing filenames in 1 folder to a format.

## How to use:

1. run file GUI.py via python console:

`py GUI.py`

2. Browse the folder to change filenames.

You can also change the folder name here via the rename folder parted

### Current Format: prefix_folder_file.

3. Lowers Cap: filenames format will be all lower cap. If not choose, capping stay the same.

4. Include folder name in filename: choose to include foldername in format. For now foldername position in format is rigid (changable in source code files.)

5. Prefix: choose a prefix for the format. left blank if does not need.

6. Space altenate: change whitespaces to this character. Left blank if does not need.

7. Update preview: update the file name preview arcording to chosen options.

8. Process Change: process to change all filename in chosen folder to current format.
